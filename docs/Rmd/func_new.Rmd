#### newProject
`newProject` creates a new named project directory structure at the specified file path.
If a directory with this project name already exists in this location on the file system and `overwrite=FALSE`, the function will abort.
Default project subdirectories are created unless a different vector of folder names is explicitly passed to ```newProject```.
If one of the subdirectories is `docs` then the default vector of subdirectories under `docs` is also created.
This argument can also be set explicitly.
The current function only creates directories, not files, so `overwrite=TRUE` is safe to use on any existing project.

```{r function1}
