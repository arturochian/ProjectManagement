\subsubsection{genAppDiv}

\texttt{genAppDiv} generates an html file storing a container div element which organizes Shiny web applications.
The function scans a directory of Shiny app subdirectories.
This apps directory should be a local repository.

Specifically, \texttt{genAppDiv} looks for a named directory of image files.
There should be one image per app, named exactly as the respective app directory is named.
Only apps with corresponding images are built into the html container.
If you wish to leave out, say, a developmental app from being linked to on you Github user website, do not include an image file for that app.

The container element includes an image link to each app's url as well as a link to the source code on Github.
Although the function scans for images in directory inside a local repository, the images referenced in the output html are of course not local.
They point to the same images stored on Github, hence why it is useful for the local directory of apps to be a Github repository.
As an example, a repository may contain the directories, \texttt{app1}, \texttt{app2}, \texttt{app3}, and \texttt{images}.

This function will probably be removed in favor of the more general \texttt{genPanelDiv} function.

\subsubsection{genPanelDiv}

\texttt{genPanelDiv} generates an html file storing a container div element which in its current state of development organizes two types of content: \textbf{R} projects and Shiny web applications.

The \texttt{type} argument can be either \texttt{projects} or \texttt{apps} and essentially bifurcates the behavior of \texttt{genPanelDiv}.
The purpose of the function is to generate an html file defining a container div element to display and reference either my \textbf{R} projects or my Shiny apps.

For projects, the function scans a directory of local repositories and takes any directories found to be the names of projects.
There is an \texttt{exclude} argument for dropping any known directories that are to be avoided.
My defaults are \texttt{exclude="leonawicz.github.io", "shiny-apps"} since the first is just a local repository for my Github user account web site and not a "project" in the same sense of my other projects
and the second is the local repository which is scanned by \texttt{genPanelDiv} when \texttt{type="apps"}.

For apps, the function scans a directory of Shiny app subdirectories.
Unlike for projects, where \texttt{genPanelDiv} scans a directory of multiple local repositories, this apps directory should be a specific local repository. The apps contained within are not inndividual repositories.
I have taken this approach for now simply because this is how my apps tend to be stored.

Specifically, the \texttt{genAppDiv} looks for a named directory of image files.
There should be one image per app, named exactly as the respective app directory is named.
Only apps with corresponding images are built into the html container.
If you wish to leave out, say, a developmental app from being linked to on you Github user website, do not include an image file for that app.

The container element includes an image link to each app's url as well as a link to the source code on Github.
Although the app scans for images in a local repository, the images referenced in the output html are of course not local.
They point to the same images stored on Github, hence why it is useful for the local directory of apps to be a Github repository.

This function makes the more specific \texttt{genAppDiv} redundant and will likely replace it.
